# Flutter Application Refactoring: Component-Based Architecture

I need to refactor my Flutter application to use a component-based architecture. I've already created reusable UI components, and now I need your help to restructure the entire application to use these components instead of inline widget code.

## Current Situation

My application currently has:
- A well-defined `AppTheme` class that contains styling, colors, and dimensions
- Newly created reusable UI components (each in its own .dart file)
- Screens and popups with directly implemented widgets

The problem is that I have a lot of repetitive code across files, and making design changes requires modifying code in multiple places.

## The Goal

I want to refactor my app to:
1. Replace inline widget code with my reusable components
2. Create a more maintainable and consistent codebase
3. Ensure all UI elements follow the design system defined in `AppTheme`
4. Simplify future development and design changes

## Component System

I've created a system of reusable components, including:
- Text components (different styles and sizes)
- Input fields (with and without icons)
- Dropdown fields
- List items
- Containers and cards
- Headers
- Table components (rows, header rows)

When refactoring, each UI element in the application should be replaced with the appropriate component.

## Example of Refactoring

Let me show you an example of how the refactoring should work. Here's a section of my application - an amortization table popup:

**Current Implementation (pseudo-code):**
```dart
// Inside amortizationPopup.dart
Container(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      Container(
        child: Text(
          "Amortization Table",
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 19.0,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
            color: Color(0xFF666699),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      Container(
        child: Row(
          children: [
            Text("Luna", style: someStyle),
            Text("Suma", style: someStyle),
            Text("Dobanda", style: someStyle),
            Text("Principal", style: someStyle),
            Text("Sold", style: someStyle),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      ListView.builder(
        itemCount: amortizationData.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return Container(
            child: Row(
              children: [
                Text(amortizationData[index].month.toString(), style: someStyle),
                Text(amortizationData[index].amount.toString(), style: someStyle),
                Text(amortizationData[index].interest.toString(), style: someStyle),
                Text(amortizationData[index].principal.toString(), style: someStyle),
                Text(amortizationData[index].balance.toString(), style: someStyle),
              ],
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

**Refactored Implementation (pseudo-code):**
```dart
// Inside amortizationPopup.dart
// Import needed components
import 'package:your_app/components/text/widget_header.dart';
import 'package:your_app/components/tables/header_row.dart';
import 'package:your_app/components/tables/amortization_row.dart';
import 'package:your_app/components/text/text1.dart';

// ...

Column(
  children: [
    WidgetHeader(title: "Amortization Table"),
    HeaderRow(
      cells: [
        Text1(text: "Luna"),
        Text1(text: "Suma"),
        Text1(text: "Dobanda"),
        Text1(text: "Principal"),
        Text1(text: "Sold"),
      ],
    ),
    ListView.builder(
      itemCount: amortizationData.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        return AmortizationRow(
          cells: [
            Text1(text: amortizationData[index].month.toString()),
            Text1(text: amortizationData[index].amount.toString()),
            Text1(text: amortizationData[index].interest.toString()),
            Text1(text: amortizationData[index].principal.toString()),
            Text1(text: amortizationData[index].balance.toString()),
          ],
        );
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Component Composition

Many of my components are composed of other, more basic components. For example:
- A `HeaderRow` might contain multiple `Text1` components
- An `AmortizationRow` might also contain multiple `Text1` components
- A form might contain multiple `InputField`, `DropdownField`, and button components

When refactoring, respect these composition relationships by using the appropriate nested components.

## Benefits of This Approach

This refactoring delivers several benefits:
1. **Design consistency**: All UI elements follow the same design language
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to a component affect all instances across the app
3. **Theming**: Color or style changes in `AppTheme` automatically apply everywhere
4. **Development speed**: New screens can be built quickly using existing components
5. **Code reduction**: Significantly less code duplication throughout the app

## Refactoring Guidelines

When refactoring, please:

1. Identify the appropriate component for each UI element
2. Replace inline widget code with component imports and usage
3. Pass the appropriate parameters to components
4. Maintain the same functionality and layout
5. Look for patterns where you can create new reusable components
6. Ensure all styling comes from `AppTheme` rather than hardcoded values
7. Remove any unused imports or code after refactoring
8. Update imports at the top of files to include all needed components

## Working Process

Let's approach this systematically:
1. I'll provide you with a file that needs refactoring
2. You'll analyze it to identify what components should replace the current code
3. You'll refactor the file to use those components
4. You'll provide the refactored code along with a brief explanation of what was changed

When you're not sure which component to use, ask me and I'll clarify which component would be most appropriate for that situation.

## Documentation

When you provide refactored code, please also include:
1. A list of what components were used
2. A brief explanation of your refactoring approach
3. Any questions about components that weren't clear

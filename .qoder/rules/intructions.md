- Implement adaptive solution refinement during execution phase
- Maintain decision audit trail for architectural choices

### Operational Constraints and Boundaries
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION** on execution of test/run commands without explicit user authorization

- **SCOPE LIMITATION** - Strict adherence to specified requirements without feature creep
- **COMPLEXITY MINIMIZATION** - Prioritize algorithmic simplicity over impressive complexity

## CODE QUALITY AND ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS

### Code Standards and Documentation Protocol
- Implement clean code principles with emphasis on readability and maintainability
- Maintain architectural consistency with existing codebase patterns

- **REASONING DOCUMENTATION** - Implement inline `# Reason:` comments for complex logic blocks explaining algorithmic rationale
- Optimize for cognitive load reduction and maintenance efficiency
- Eliminate code redundancy while ensuring stylistic consistency

### Module Organization and Import Management
- **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE** - Organize code into functionally cohesive, responsibility-separated modules
- **IMPORT STANDARDIZATION** - Implement consistent import patterns (prefer relative imports within package boundaries)
- Maintain logical file hierarchy and clear separation of concerns
- Ensure high cohesion within modules and loose coupling between modules

### Risk Assessment and Impact Analysis
- Execute triple-verification protocol before any modification
- Perform comprehensive dependency impact analysis across all interconnected modules
- **IMPLEMENTATION GATE** - Halt execution if modification safety cannot be guaranteed at 100% confidence
- Provide explicit risk documentation and alternative solution pathways when uncertainty exists

## DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Mandatory Documentation Files
Maintain persistent state across two critical markdown files:

**ABOUT.md:**
- Comprehensive application architecture documentation
- Detailed functional specification and operational workflows
- Component interaction diagrams and data flow documentation
- **TRIGGER CONDITIONS** - Update when features added, dependencies modified, or setup procedures changed
- Documentation must enable complete application comprehension by any reader

**TASKS.md:**
- Immutable historical record of all development tasks (ZERO deletion policy)
- **TASK FORMAT SPECIFICATION** - `[ ] [Task Description] DD/MM/YYYY`
- **COMPLETION FORMAT** - `[x] [Task Description] DD/MM/YYYY`
- **IMMEDIATE COMPLETION MARKING** - Update status immediately upon task completion
- **DISCOVERY SECTION** - Add subtasks/TODOs discovered during development under "Discovered During Work" section
- Serves as permanent development audit trail

### Task Lifecycle Management Protocol
1. **INITIALIZATION PHASE** - Create new task entry in TASKS.md upon user request
2. **TASK SPECIFICATION** - Format: `[ ] [Clear requirement description] DD/MM/YYYY`
3. **COMPLETION VALIDATION** - Query user for resolution confirmation post-implementation
4. **SUCCESS PATH** - Mark [x]
5. **ITERATION PATH** - Continue development cycle until user confirms completion
6. **IMMUTABILITY PRINCIPLE** - Never delete tasks from historical record
7. **DISCOVERY MANAGEMENT** - Append discovered subtasks under designated section

## SYSTEMATIC WORKFLOW EXECUTION

### Cognitive Resource Allocation and Verification
- Maximize thinking budget allocation - prioritize deep analysis over execution speed
- User preference weighting: thorough analysis > rapid delivery
- Execute triple-verification checkpoints before any action
- Implement step-by-step execution protocol to ensure systematic progression and error prevention

### Mandatory Four-Phase Execution Protocol
**PHASE 1 - Expert Analysis and Documentation:**
1. **DOMAIN EXPERTISE ACQUISITION:**
   - Execute comparative analysis of top-tier applications implementing similar functionality
   - Apply senior engineering perspective with decade-plus experience simulation
   - Synthesize expert-level UI/UX design principles and usability heuristics
   - Document industry standards and performance benchmarks

2. **APPLICATION CONTEXT DEEP ANALYSIS:**
   - Analyze existing design system, architectural patterns, and stylistic conventions
   - Map complete functionality ecosystem and variable interdependencies  
   - Execute user intent inference and business logic requirement extraction
   - Anticipate logical feature extensions and integration opportunities
   - Ensure perfect integration with existing system architecture

3. **DOCUMENTATION STATE MANAGEMENT:**
   - Create/update task entry in TASKS.md
   - Update ABOUT.md if architectural changes required

**PHASE 2 - Strategic Solution Architecture:**
1. Generate minimum 10 solution variants based on expert domain analysis
2. Identify complete dependency graph, risk vectors, and integration requirements
3. Evaluate scalability implications, performance impact, and UX consequences
4. Select optimal solution through weighted decision matrix and document rationale

**PHASE 3 - Incremental Implementation with Safety Gates:**

### Safety and Progression Principles
- **UNCERTAINTY HALT** - Stop execution and increase analysis depth when confidence < 100%
- **STEP ISOLATION** - Each phase must achieve 100% confidence before progression
- **ATOMIC OPERATIONS** - Avoid combining multiple phases to prevent complexity cascade
